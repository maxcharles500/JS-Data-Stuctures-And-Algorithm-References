//Trees
//A data structure that consists of nodes in a Parent/Child relationship
    //Lists are linear: 1 path to traverse it
    //Trees are NOT-Linear: many different paths you can take
//Trees only have 1 entry point: or the root which is the "top" node of the tree
    //Root - top node of the tree
    //Child - A node directly connected to another node while moving away from the tree
    //Parent - the converse notion of a child 
    //Siblings - a group of nodes with the same parent 
    //Leaf - a node with no children
    //Edge - the connection between one node and another(usually vsualized as a line or arrow connecting parent to child)
//Use Cases: 
    //HTML DOM is a tree (elements with nested elements is a parent to child relationship)
    //Network Routing
    //Abstract syntax Trees
    //Artificial intelligence
    //Folder within a computers OS
    //Computer filing system(finder, cd mkdir cd .. are all ways to traverse the filing tree)
    //JSON data
